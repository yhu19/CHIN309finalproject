#### Still Night Thoughts

Moonlight in front of my bed-

I took it for frost on the ground!

I lift my head, gaze at the bright moon,

lower it and dream of home.


- Translated by Burton Watson

Simplified Chinese version:

《静夜思》

床前明月光

疑是地上霜

举头望明月

低头思故乡

This poem is about the feeling of missing one's hometown in the silent moonlight night.

The first two stanzas of the poem are about the illusion that the poet has for a moment in the specific environment of being a guest in another country. A person who is alone in another country can dilute his sorrow during the daytime, but when it is late at night, his heart will inevitably be filled with waves of longing for his hometown. The moon is bright, not to mention the autumn night, when the moon is as frosty. These two lines vividly express that the poet woke up from a sleep and mistook the cold moonlight in front of his bed for the frost on the ground in his daze. The word "frost" expresses even more, describing not only the brightness of the moonlight, but also the coldness of the season, and underlining the poet's loneliness and desolation in his homeland. In the last two lines of the poem, the poet deepens his homesickness through the portrayal of his movements and demeanor, showing that the poet has turned from being confused to being awake.
